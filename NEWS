Version 0.3 (2014-08-05)
===
API Break: `list.search` now evaluates expression recursively in a list and supports limited lambda expression (only value is defined).

Add `exact()`, `equal()`, `include()`, `pattern()`, and `like()` comparer functions for logical and fuzzy filtering and searching.

Add `List()` to provide an environment in which most list functions are defined for light-weight chaining that does not reply on external operators.

Version 0.2.5 (2014-08-01)
===
Add `list.apply` which is a wrapper function of lapply.
Add `list.search` that searches a list recursively.
Add exact search functions: `equal`, `unequal`, `unidentical`, `include`, and `exclude`.
Add fuzzy search functions: `like` and `unlike` based on stringdist package.
Enhance `list.clean` which now supports recursive cleaning.

Version 0.2.4 (2014-07-26)
===
Add `list.common` that returns the common cases of all list member by expression.


Version 0.2.3 (2014-07-18)
===
Improve performance (#26, #27)
Add `list.flatten` that flattens a nested list to one-level.



Version 0.2.2 (2014-07-11)
===
Add `list.stack` that binds list members to a data.frame.
Add `list.zip` that combines multiple lists element-wisely.
Add `list.maps` that performs mapping over multiple lists.
Performance improvements.
Minor maintainence updates.
`list.cases` supports list-like cases
