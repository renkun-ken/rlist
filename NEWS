Version 0.3-3 (2014-10-09)
===
Update documentation
Improve function implementation
Remove summary.list()
Deprecate equal()

Version 0.3-2 (2014-08-21)
===
Fix environemnt issues (#50).
Deprecate lambda expression of the form "x -> expr", use "x ~ expr" instead.
Add subsetting, extracing, and assigning functionality to List environment.

Version 0.3-1 (2014-08-10)
===
Add `list.subset` that supports list subsetting by name, index, pattern matching, string distance to names.
`List$subset` switched from `subset.list` to `list.subset`.

Version 0.3 (2014-08-08)
===
API Break: `list.search` now evaluates expression recursively in a list and supports lambda expression.

Add `equal()` function for logical and fuzzy filtering and searching which supports exact equality, atomic equality, inclusion, pattern matching, string-distance tolerance.

Add `List()` to provide an environment in which most list functions are defined for light-weight chaining that does not rely on external operators.



Version 0.2.5 (2014-08-01)
===
Add `list.apply` which is a wrapper function of lapply.
Add `list.search` that searches a list recursively.
Add exact search functions: `equal`, `unequal`, `unidentical`, `include`, and `exclude`.
Add fuzzy search functions: `like` and `unlike` based on stringdist package.
Enhance `list.clean` which now supports recursive cleaning.

Version 0.2.4 (2014-07-26)
===
Add `list.common` that returns the common cases of all list member by expression.


Version 0.2.3 (2014-07-18)
===
Improve performance (#26, #27)
Add `list.flatten` that flattens a nested list to one-level.



Version 0.2.2 (2014-07-11)
===
Add `list.stack` that binds list members to a data.frame.
Add `list.zip` that combines multiple lists element-wisely.
Add `list.maps` that performs mapping over multiple lists.
Performance improvements.
Minor maintainence updates.
`list.cases` supports list-like cases
Fixed [#23](https://github.com/renkun-ken/rlist/issues/23)
Fixed [#25](https://github.com/renkun-ken/rlist/issues/25)
`list.select` no longer accepts explicit lambda expressions.
Vignettes updated


Version 0.2.1 (2014-07-04)
